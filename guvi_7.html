                    <h2>VISUAL CREATIVITY</h2>
                    <p>There's more visual freedom in parallax website design. Rather than <br>focusing on block style
                        information architecture, you can create <br>refreshing and engaging visuals such as animations
                        or beautiful<br>photography,that act as a continuum, ultimately inspiring users to<br>scroll
                        further down the page </p>

                    <p>do you want to tell a story with your product or service? <br> Long-scrolling lends itself well
                        to a narrative and <br> encourages meaningful interaction from user</p>

                    <p>mobile and tablets have evolved the way we engage in websites. It's <br>now less about clicking

                        clicking through to another page<br>requires thought and motivation. A single page
                        website<br>allows user to identify their purpose on the website quicker,<br>than needing to

                    <p id="para-1">one of the biggest problems that parallax websites faces is that <br>they are not SEO
                        friendly.why? When you limit the numbers of <br>pages on your website,Google has fewer pages to
                        index and <br> negatively impacts your standing on the search engine
                        results<br>page(SERP).Luckily there are ways around this</p>

                    <p id=para-2>50% of websites users bounce off the page if it hasn't loaded in 3-5 seconds. Sp the
                        <br>more high resolution imagery and animations you include, the longer it takes to <br> load
                        the page.When weriting this article, we tested some popular parallax<br>websites, and found that
                        the ones with complex visuals took up to 30 seconds to<br>load on amobile device,whereas simple
